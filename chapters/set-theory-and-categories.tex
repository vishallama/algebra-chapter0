\section{Naive set theory}
\begin{xca}
Let $U = \{ x \mid x \not\in x \}$. Then, $U \not\in U \iff U \in U$, a
contradiction. This is Russell's paradox. Either we assume the \emph{set of all
sets} doesn't exist, or we need to give up the axiom of \emph{unrestricted
comprehension} in set theory.
\end{xca}

\begin{xca}
Suppose $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on a set $S$. For every element $a \in
S$, define the \emph{equivalence class} of $a$ (with respect to $\sim$) by
\begin{center}
$[a]_{\sim} := \{ b \in S \mid b \sim a \}$.
\end{center}
Then, we note that due to \emph{reflexivity}, the equivalence class
$[a]_{\sim}$ of every element $a \in S$ contains $a$, and hence, is nonempty.
Also, $[a]_{\sim} \subset S$, and therefore, $\bigcup_{a \in S} [a]_{\sim} =
S$. Finally, we show the equivalence classes are mutually disjoint. Indeed, for
any two elements $a, b \in S$, if $[a]_{\sim}$ and $[b]_{\sim}$ are disjoint,
then there is nothing to prove. So, suppose $[a]_{\sim} \cap [b]_{\sim}$ is
nonempty. Then, there exists some $c \in S$ that belongs to such an
intersection. Thus, $c \sim a$ and $c \sim b$. By symmetry, $a \sim c$, and
thus, by transitivity, $a \sim b$, which by symmetry again, implies $b \sim a$.
Therefore, for all $x \in [a]_{\sim}$, we have $x \sim a$, and since $a \sim
b$, by transitivity, $x \sim b$, which implies $x \in [b]_{\sim}$, from which
we conclude $[a]_{\sim} \subset [b]_{\sim}$. We can similarly show $[b]_{\sim}
\subset [a]_{\sim}$. Hence, $[a]_{\sim} = [b]_{\sim}$. This establishes
equivalence classes are mutually disjoint. Hence, the set $\mathscr{P}_{\sim}$
of equivalence classes of $S$ is indeed a partition of $S$.
\end{xca}

\begin{xca}
Suppose $\mathscr{P}$ is a partition on a set $S$. Define a relation $\sim$ on
$S$ as follows: For any two elements $a, b \in S$, $a \sim b$ iff $a$ and $b$
belong to the same set in the partition. Then, it is easy to check $\sim$ is
indeed an equivalence relation on $S$. $\mathscr{P}$ is, therefore, the
corresponding partition of the aforesaid equivalence relation, and we are done.
\end{xca}

\begin{xca}
Note the set of equivalence relations on a set $S$ are in a one-to-one
correspondence with the set of partitions of $S$. Thus, the number of different
equivalence relations that may be defined on $S = \{ 1, 2, 3\}$ equals the
number of partitions of $S$, and this number equals $5$, since the partitions
of $S$ are
\begin{center}
    $\{ \{ 1 \}, \{ 2 \}, \{ 3 \} \}, \{ \{ 1, 2 \}, \{ 3 \} \}, \{ \{ 1, 3 \},
    \{ 2 \} \}, \{ \{ 2, 3 \}, \{ 1 \} \}, \{ \{ 1, 2, 3 \} \}$.
\end{center}
The above partitions are also written as $1|2|3, 12|3, 13|2, 23|1, 123$.
\end{xca}

\begin{xca}
An example of a relation $R$ (defined on a set $S$) that is reflexive and
symmetric but not transitive is the following:
\begin{center}
$R = \{ (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2) \}$, where
$S = \{ 1,2,3 \}$.
\end{center}
\end{xca}

\begin{xca}
Define a relation $\sim$ on the set $\R$ of real numbers by setting
\begin{center}
 $a \sim b \iff b - a \in \mathbb{Z}$.
\end{center}
We claim $\sim$ is an equivalence relation. To that end, note, for all $a \in
\R$, we have $a \sim a$, since $a - a = 0 \in \Z$. Therefore, $\sim$ is
reflexive. Also, if $a \sim b$, then $b - a \in \Z$, which implies $a - b \in
\Z$, and thus, $b \sim a$. Therefore, $\sim$ is symmetric. Finally, suppose $a
\sim b$ and $b \sim c$. Then, $b - a, c - b \in \Z$, and thus, $c - a = (c - b)
+ (b - a) \in \Z$. Thus, $\sim$ is transitive. Therefore, $\sim$ is an
equivalence relation on $\R$.

(Description of $\sim$) Note all reals that have the same decimal expansion
belong to the same equivalence class under $\sim$. Thus, $[0]_{\sim} = \Z$, and
for any $0 < \alpha < 1, [\alpha]_{\sim} = \{ n + \alpha \mid n \in \Z \}$. This
takes care of all the reals, since each real can always be written as $n +
\alpha$, for some $n \in \Z$ and $0 < \alpha < 1$. Therefore, a `compelling'
description for $\R/{\sim}$ is the unit interval $[0,1]$, such that the
endpoints, $0$ and $1$, are `glued' together. In other words, it is a `loop'
or a 1-sphere.\\

Define a relation $\approx$ on the plane $\R \times \R$ as follows:
\begin{center}
$(a_1, a_2) \approx (b_1, b_2) \iff b_1 - a_1 \in \Z \text{ and }
b_2 - a_2 \in \Z$.
\end{center}
Then, just as above, it is easy to show $\approx$ defines an equivalence
relation on $\R \times \R$. We note $[(0,0)]_{\sim} = \{ (m,n) \mid m,n \in \Z
\}$, and for any $0 < \alpha, \beta < 1, [(\alpha, \beta)]_{\sim} = \{ (m +
\alpha, n + \beta) \mid m,n \in \Z \}$. Thus, a `compelling' description of $\R
\times \R/{\approx}$ is the unit square $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ with the four
corners joined together, so that it forms a 2-sphere.
